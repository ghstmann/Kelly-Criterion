    "# The Kelly Criteria without the Log Transformation\n",
    "\n",
    "Of the three main bet sizing methods in finance, the Kelly Criteria is arguably the most fun, maybe due to its use in sports betting.  (The other two are Markowitz optimization and the Gordon Growth model.)   People have been trying to extend it for decades and it is a popular discussion topic among investors. Warren Buffett once said:\n",
    "\n",
    ">I have 2 views on diversification. If you are a professional and have confidence, then I would advocate lots of concentration. For everyone else, if it's not your game, participate in total diversification. So this means that professionals use Kelly and amateurs better off with index funds following the capital asset pricing model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kelly made an interesting modeling decision in his original 1956 publication to wrap potential gains inside of a logarithm.  Without fail, every other paper has used the same transformation.  The main arguments in the earliest papers was that the transform implied working with growth rates instead of resulting wealth.  I'm going to show that this decision led to some awkward behavior and that removing it solves those issues. \n",
    "\n",
    "There was one interesting discussion between the economist Paul Samuelson and Professor William Ziemba which ran from 2008 to 2012 about how the logarithic utility used by Kelly was not sound economics.  You can find the conversation <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2161068\">here</a>.  This was also published in the Journal of Portfolio Management in 2015.\n",

    "$ \\frac{V_T}{V_o}^{1/N} \\approx (1 + f\\ b)^\\rho (1 - f)^{(1 - \\rho)}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking the natural logarithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{1}{N}(Ln(V_T) - Ln(V_o)) = \\rho\\ Ln(1 + f\\ b) + (1 - \\rho)\\ Ln(1 - f)$\n",
