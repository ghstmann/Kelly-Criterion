    "## Kelly Criterion - a limited bibliography\n",
    "\n",
    "The following are many of the most important papers to date on the Kelly Criterion, along with a few where authors tried to extend the method.  In most cases, I tried to summarize the main finding or findings.  In a couple, I highlighted where the authors might have gone astray, hopefully in a tactful way.  While I view all research as good, understanding where more work can be done is useful.  Often, find that work lies in looking for potential weaknesses in the existing literature."

Later papers credit Breiman for proving that optimzing the expectation of the log of wealth is desirable.  Others credit Latane (1959) for proving that optimizing the geometric mean of wealth is superior.</i></font>\n",

Much of it is a counter-argument to Paul Samuelson who stated that lognormal utility is not a good utility function for modeling.

He also says that using Kelly for portfolio optimization led him to achieve a 25% annual return.  The work was supposed to be in his 1967 book, Beat the Market.</i></font>\n",

One interesting anecdote is that the author and a Ph.D. candidate bet on sports, turning \\$50,000 into \\$123,000 over four and a half months in 1994.  Other notable derivations are (1) two independent bets, showing that the optimal bet sizes are not independent, (2) a intro to correlated bets though the analysis is brief and not fleshed out, and (3) some application to stock portfolios, albeit with only two stocks. There is a nice multivariate derivation but the symbols are unclear and require significant analysis to understand.
