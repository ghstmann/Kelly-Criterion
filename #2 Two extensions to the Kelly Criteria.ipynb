    "In their discussion, Thorpe gave an example of investing in stocks where there were three outcomes.  This was somewhat exciting, to think he would provide a solution for a three-outcome setup.  Instead, the middle outcome was set to zero and he used the standard Kelly setup.  Today, we will look at two extensions to Kelly:\n",
